    <p id="title">Chicken Makhani is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It is a full flavored dish that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne.</p>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ white onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Saute shallot and onion until soft and translucent. Stir in butter, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin and bay leaf. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat, and season with 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Stir cooked chicken into sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix together cornstarch and water, then stir into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
