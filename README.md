### üõ†Ô∏è This project is on temporary hiatus, check out my [github](https://github.com/Noway-code/) to see what i'm working on now.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Project Recipes Page! This project is designed to help me practice and reinforce my HTML skills. This is a basic recipe website that includes a main index page with links to different recipes. This is more focused on honing my HTML skills rather than design skills.
## Project Highlights

- Build a basic recipe website.
- Create a main index page with links to various recipes.
- Emphasis on strengthening HTML skills.
- Aesthetic improvements with CSS will be tackled in future iterations.
